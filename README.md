# Solar-Predictor

The beginnings of a 

## Concept

The current state of the US electric grid does not provide a good fit for the variable behavior of solar (and other renewable) generation sources
Some modelling of systems exists and has been used to some extent by utilities looking to predict their load more effectively given the new generation sources.
However, the models that I have encountered give total monthly kilowatt hour generation numbers at their most granular.  The reason for this being that the financial relationship
between the utility and developer is a Power Purchase Agreement, meaning that all killowatt hours generated will be purchased by the utility for a certain price.

However, in order to truly facilitate the ever increasing injection of solar generation into the electric grid, more real-time prediction will be necessary, hopefully down to a few hours out.
